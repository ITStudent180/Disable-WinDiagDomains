# Disable-WinDiagDomains
Powershell script to disable windows diagnostic domains. Contributions are welcomed. 
Hello Guys,
After the lack of trustworthy tools concerning Windows tracking I decided to make my own script. 
This script is meant to be simple and easy to vet for malware.
This script is based on microsoft documentation on domains used for 4 different types of diagnostic data.
Big and small contributions are welcomed.
